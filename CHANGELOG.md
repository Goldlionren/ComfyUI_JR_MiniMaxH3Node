- Added `JR H3 Adaptive Cache` with Auto, Visual Fast, Dialogue Safe, Action Safe, Balanced, and Off modes.
- Added separate video/audio relative-delta metrics, full-step fast path, block-probe middle cache, tail refresh, forced refresh, cache-device selection, invalidation, statistics, and cache-conflict detection.
- Added Mock H3 path tests, deterministic Router/config tests, metric and state-reset tests, algorithm documentation, and a manual benchmark result tool.
- Kept Prompt Optimizer inputs, outputs, system prompt, response parsing, and workflow behavior unchanged.
